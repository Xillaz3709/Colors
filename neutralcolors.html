        <h1>Neutral Colors</h1>
      <div class="section">
        <p>Neutral colors are a cornerstone of design, valued for their versatility, subtlety, and timeless appeal. These colors, which include shades of <span class="accent-color">white</span>, <span class="accent-color">gray</span>, <span class="accent-color">black</span>, <span class="accent-color">brown</span>, and <span class="accent-color">beige</span>, serve as a balancing force in any composition, providing a calm and stable foundation. Their understated presence allows them to complement bold colors, create harmony, and evoke feelings of sophistication and simplicity.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <p><span class="accent-color">White</span>, often associated with purity, cleanliness, and openness, is a popular choice in minimalist design. It reflects light and can make spaces feel larger and more airy, offering a sense of clarity and freshness. When paired with other neutral or bold hues, white creates a clean backdrop that lets accent colors shine. It's especially effective in modern designs where simplicity is key.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <p><span class="accent-color">Gray</span>, a perfect intermediary between <span class="accent-color">black</span> and <span class="accent-color">white</span>, is a neutral powerhouse that conveys balance and elegance. Its versatility comes from the wide range of shades it offers, from light silvers to deep charcoals. Light <span class="accent-color">gray</span> is soothing and neutral, while darker tones can evoke depth and sophistication. As a result, <span class="accent-color">gray</span> is commonly used in both contemporary and classic designs to add a touch of refinement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <p><span class="accent-color">Brown</span>, the most earthy of the neutral colors, is associated with warmth, comfort, and stability. From soft tans to rich chocolates, brown's natural tones can ground a design, evoking a cozy and inviting atmosphere. <span class="accent-color">Beige</span>, a lighter variant of brown, is equally versatile, offering warmth without overwhelming a composition. These tones are often used in rustic, bohemian, or natural-inspired designs to create a sense of authenticity and connection to the natural world.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <p>Neutral colors have an unparalleled ability to adapt to any setting, acting as a subtle canvas or a statement in their own right. Their enduring charm lies in their simplicity and ability to evoke a wide range of moods, from calm and understated to bold and dramatic, depending on how they are paired with other colors. In any creative endeavor, neutrals remain an essential tool for achieving balance, depth, and timeless appeal.</p>
