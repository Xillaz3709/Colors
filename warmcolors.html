        <p><span class="accent-color">Red</span>, one of the most intense warm colors, often represents love, courage, and power. It has a stimulating effect that can raise energy levels and attract attention, which is why it is commonly used in advertisements, branding, and warning signs. While it can signify passion and excitement, red is also linked to aggression and urgency, requiring careful use to avoid overwhelming viewers.</p>

        <p><span class="accent-color">Orange</span>, a blend of red and yellow, carries a sense of warmth and excitement without the intensity of red. It symbolizes creativity, joy, and optimism, making it a popular choice in designs that aim to convey friendliness or approachability. From vibrant tangerines to earthy rust tones, orange can adapt to various contexts, creating a dynamic and inviting atmosphere.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <p><span class="accent-color">Yellow</span>, the brightest and most cheerful of the warm colors, is often associated with happiness, sunshine, and hope. It can stimulate mental activity and create a sense of playfulness, making it ideal for designs targeting younger audiences or projects that aim to inspire positivity. However, excessive yellow can sometimes lead to feelings of anxiety, so itâ€™s best used in moderation or balanced with neutral tones.</p>
